## What all can you intercept: Calls and SMS

This tool can help you intercept calls and SMS from all the cellular devices in a radial distance of around 8.5 Km. Once you initiate the simulator on your phone and the server client receiver on your dekstop/laptop, the intercepter will activate. All the incoming and outgoing calls/sms will be listed on the receiver client on desktop. Recording feature is also available if you wish to record any live phone call. Or you can add certain phone numbers in your recording panel so that it automatically records all incoming and outgoing calls on this phone.

More instructions are in the manula file.
